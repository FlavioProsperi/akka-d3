### Overview

Akka-d3 is a library which provides abstractions for doing Domain Driven Design using Event Sourcing and CQRS, possibly in a distributed way. It is built on top of Akka, and works as an extension to it.

### Getting Started

Akka-d3 is currently available for Scala 2.11 & 2.12.

To get started with SBT, simply add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```Scala
libraryDependencies += "io.pjan" %% "akka-d3" % "0.1.1"
```

This will pull in all of Akka-d3's modules. If you only require some functionality, you can pick-and-choose from amongst these modules (used in place of "akka-d3"):

 * `akka-d3-core`: Core of akka-d3. Allows you to run the write side in single-node mode (*required*).
 * `akka-d3-cluster`: Module to extend the write side of akka-d3 so aggregates can be sharded over multiple nodes.
